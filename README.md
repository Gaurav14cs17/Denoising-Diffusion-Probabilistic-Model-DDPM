# Denoising-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model-DDPM-
This implementation follows default ResNet blocks architecture without any multiplying factors for simplicity. Also current UNet implementation works better with 128×128 resolution (see next sections) and thus has 5 feature map resoltuions (128 → 64 → 32 → 16 → 8).
